<p>The game is about finding a map that leads to a vault with loads of treasure but a band of cultists are trying to steal it.</p> 
<p>You have to kill all the cultists with the millions of guns that are in the game and most of them have 2 different firing modes.</p> 
<p>You have a choice of 4 characters which I have spoken about in my home page. And when you choose one you meet new npc characters that help you find the vault.</p> 
<p>Bellow is one of them called Claptrap.</p>
