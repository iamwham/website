<p>Gearbox developed the game and it was published by 2k games.The game made an appearance at the 2019 E3 event and it got a very positive reaction. Being one of the few games this year which showed  actual gameplay unlike the clearly pre rendered battlefied 5. Its unique art style makes it one of the most different game  </p>

<p>Borderlands 3 has a excellent and funny campaign but it can feel like a bit of a grind at sometimes. All of the guns in the game are completely free to use and the game isnt pay to win at all. There are billions of different guns all with 2 different firing modes</p>
